# book-reccomendation-app
Book recommender app built with Streamlit. Preprocesses a CSV of books, cleans text, computes TF‑IDF vectors and cosine similarity, and blends similarity with rating and rating_count. Select a title to see top similar books with covers rendered from the dataset’s image_url column. Fast, simple, and local.
